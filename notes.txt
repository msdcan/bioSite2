<h3> Popcorn Anyone? </h3>

<p> 
    The perfect past time that will take you to whimsically unique realities and action-packed battles all with the click of a remote.
    Or a pre-purchased ticket. Zhordera enjoys movies and television to relax after long draining days. 
    The distractions of these stories bring joy where there is pain, healing where there may be suffering, 
    and excitement in place of the mind-numbing worries. 

</p>




<h3> 1 Fish, 2 Fish....  </h3>

<p>
    Growing up in the country sides of her hometown, fishing became a regular pass time during Zee's childhood.
    Even to this day, she enjoys gathering her friends and family, a couple of snacks, and her fishing rod
    to head out to snag the catch of the day!

</p>




<h3> Where to Next? </h3>

<p> 
    Just like most hard-working individuals, traveling is one of the most desired activities. 
    Zhordera is no different. Having memberships that grant her access to resorts anywhere in the country, 
    she makes sure to take advantage of that. Having the opportunities, or blessings as Zhordera puts it, 
    to be able to travel and visit new places and people is something a lot wish they had. She is grateful to be able to take getaways when she can.
