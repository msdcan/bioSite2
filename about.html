<h2> About </h2>


<div class="column1of3">

   <p> Zhordera Cannon, playfully known as Zee or Doobug by her coworkers and family, was born and raised in 
    South Carolina, where she currently resides today. Described as trustworthy, thoughtful, and having a 
    great sense of humor, Zhordera’s genuineness and never-ending positive attitude has always made her a bright beacon for those around her. 
    From a young age she has always taken care of others. Whether it was unvoluntary or not, Zhordera has 
    always put forth unconditional love when it comes to the care of others. This prompted her to pursue a career in healthcare. </p>

   <p> After 29 years of her devotion to nursing, Zhordera still has a lot of love and care to give in this challenging field. 
    Although she does enjoy working face to face with her patients, she hopes to one day enjoy a quiet desk job, 
    still in health care, to enjoy for her last few years before retirement. When not working long days in scrubs, 
    Zhordera enjoys being whisked away into a variety of television and films. When not watching her favorite Marvel films, 
    you can catch her dancing to her favorite songs or traveling to a new destination. Her dream vacation: Alaska! 
    However, the one thing that never fails to center Zhordera is the love for her religion and her family, 
    all of which motivates her to continue to be a positive light. </p>
